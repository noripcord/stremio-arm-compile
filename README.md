# stremio-arm-compile

Hi! If you have an ARM computer, use linux (ubuntu 20 for now) and would like to use Stremio, here's what you should do: 

sudo /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noripcord/stremio-arm-compile/main/ubuntu_20.sh)"

Give it your password, 'cause it's sudo. Also, be sure to have curl installed on your system. Give it a time, it will install, for fucksakee


FYI: Stremio doesn't work well anymore on new macs. I figure it's 'cause they're making it work badly, like on purpose. So if you use a new mac (with the M1 chip) you can install a virtual machine with linux and install Stremio with this script.
