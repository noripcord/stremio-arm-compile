# stremio-arm-compile

Hi! If you have an ARM computer, use linux (ubuntu 20 for now) and would like to use Stremio, here's what you should do: 

/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noripcord/stremio-arm-compile/main/ubuntu_20.sh)"


Be sure to have curl installed on your system. Give it a time, it will install, for fucksakee
